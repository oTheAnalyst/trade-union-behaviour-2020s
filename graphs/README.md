# Trade-Union-Analysis


## Method
This analysis will be conducted using the following programs: R programming and Tableau.

This project explores unions and their relationship to each other and the nation-states that govern them. So far, there will be four analyses: a linear regression analysis exploring the relationship between union density and collective bargaining agreement coverage. A time series analysis of the trade union database on the state of unions globally and in the United States. A comparative analysis between the United States and the rest of the world. Lastly, a descriptive analysis consisting of frequency tables will analyze the whole trade union database.


## About The Datasets

**SDG indicator 8.8.2 - Level of national compliance with labour rights (freedom of association and collective bargaining) based on ILO textual sources and national legislation -- Annual**  
  
SDG indicator 8.8.2 seeks to measure the level of national compliance with fundamental labour rights (freedom of association and collective bargaining or FACB). It has a range from 0 to 10, with 0 being the best possible score (indicating higher levels of compliance with FACB rights) and 10 the worst (indicating lower levels of compliance with FACB rights). It is based on six ILO supervisory body textual sources and also on national legislation. National law is not enacted for the purpose of generating a statistical indicator of compliance with fundamental rights, nor were any of the ILO textual sources created for this purpose. Indicator 8.8.2 is compiled from these sources and its use does not constitute a waiver of the respective ILO Constituents> divergent points of view on the sources> conclusions. SDG indicator 8.8.2 is not intended as a tool to compare compliance among ILO member States. It should specifically be noted that reporting obligations of an ILO member State to the ILO>s supervisory system and thus ILO textual sources are different for ratifying and non-ratifying ILO member States. For more information, refer to the [Labour Market-related SDG Indicators (ILOSDG) database description](https://ilostat.ilo.org/resources/concepts-and-definitions/description-sustainable-development-labour-market-indicators/).  

### Collective bargaining coverage rate (%) -- Annual (ILO)
  
The collective bargaining coverage rate conveys the number of employees whose pay and/or conditions of employment are determined by one or more collective agreement(s) as a percentage of the total number of employees. Collective bargaining coverage includes, to the extent possible, workers covered by collective agreements in virtue of their extension. Collective bargaining coverage rates are adjusted for the possibility that some workers do not have the right to bargain collectively over wages (e.g. workers in the public services who have their wages determined by state regulation or other methods involving consultation), unless otherwise stated in the notes. The statistics presented in this table result from an ILO data compilation effort (including an annual questionnaire and numerous special enquiries), with contributions from J. Visser. For more information, refer to the [Industrial Relations data (IRdata) database description](https://ilostat.ilo.org/resources/concepts-and-definitions/description-industrial-relations-data/).  

### Trade Union Density ILO
Trade union density rate (%) -- Annual
A trade union is defined as a workers' organization constituted for the purpose of furthering and defending the interests of workers. This trade union density rate conveys the number of union members who are employees as a percentage of the total number of employees. For the purpose of this indicator in particular, trade union membership excludes union members who are not in paid employment (self-employed, unemployed, retired, etc.), unless otherwise stated in the notes. The statistics presented in this table result from an ILO data compilation effort (including an annual questionnaire and numerous special enquiries), with contributions from J. Visser. For more information, refer to the [Industrial Relations data (IRdata) database description](https://ilostat.ilo.org/resources/concepts-and-definitions/description-industrial-relations-data/).  

### Collective Bargaining Coverage(stata)
The database on Institutional Characteristics of Trade Unions, Wage Setting, State Intervention and Social Pacts (ICTWSS) has been developed by Prof. Jelle Visser at the University of Amsterdam. It was first released in May 2007. In its initial form, the ICTWSS database combined data from various sources and projects with a main focus on trade union in EU and OECD countries, collective bargaining and employment relations in Europe, and social pacts. In 2021, the ICTWSS database has been rebranded as the OECD/AIAS ICTWSS database. This new name reflects the joint effort by the OECD and AIAS-HSI to ensure the continuation of the database after Prof. Visserâ€™s retirement. The OECD/AIAS ICTWSS database is publicly available at:

## Small Multiple Line Graph Union Density.

Union Density is the measure of the amount of employees within a country's industries who are members of a union. The graphs below show union density throughout 4 to 5 years.
